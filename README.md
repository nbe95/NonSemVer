# NonSemVer

## The problem

We live in a world which is far from perfect. Everybody should obviously utilize [Semantic
Versioning](http://semver.org/), but every now and then, a client chooses to not stick with
standards and cut their own path.

    XX.YY.ZZzz-NNNN
    |  |  | |  |
    |  |  | |  +---- Build number (internal)
    |  |  | +------- Patch release
    |  |  +--------- Minor release
    |  +------------ Major release = year of deployment
    +--------------- Customer identification

## The solution

Having to work with such a specific version scheme, this script comes in very handy. While humans
often suffer from the pitfalls of non-standard and unintuitive conventions, `version.sh` is able to
properly show, parse and even increment any version number if needed.

This makes it the ideal tool for use in CI pipelines etc.

### Features and examples

- Parse version tags in dot-style or integer notation:

        $ ./version.sh v12.34.5678
        12.34.5678
        $ ./version.sh 98.76.5432
        98.76.5432
        $ ./version.sh 24681012
        24.68.1012

- Return bare integer version tags with `-i` or `--integer`:

        $ ./version.sh -i 9.8.7
        9080007
        $ ./version.sh -i 00.00.0005
        5

- Print verbose and human-readable information with `-v` or `--verbose`

        $ ./version.sh -i -v 01.42.5069
        1425069

        Customer:       1
        Major:          2042
        Minor:          50
        Patch:          69

- When running in a Git repository, automatically fetch the latest tag as version identifier:

        $ git tag
        1.2.30
        $ ./version.sh
        01.02.0030

- Increment version numbers (with respect to the current year, e.g. 2023):

        $ ./version.sh --bump-minor 11.23.0607
        11.23.0700
        $ ./version.sh --bump-major 11.23.0607
        11.23.0608
        $ ./version.sh --bump-minor 11.20.1234
        11.23.0100

Run `./version.sh --help` or take a look at the unit tests to see all available options.
